This repository releases the code of our paper ["Going Grayscale: The Road to Understanding and Improving Unlearnable Examples"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13244).

### Overview

We first show that grayscale pre-filtering (S1: Reactive Exploiter) can be used to mitigate original unlearnable examples ([Huang et al. 2021](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iAmZUo0DxC0)). 
Then, we propose adaptive unlearnable examples (S2: Adaptive Defender) that are resistant to grayscale pre-filtering. 
We also show that unlearnable examples generated using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are effective in the case of complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers.

Our code is mainly based on the [official code](https://github.com/HanxunH/Unlearnable-Examples/) of the original unlearnable exmaple work ([Huang et al. 2021](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iAmZUo0DxC0)). 

### How to use the code:

### 1. Generate ULEs in our S1 and S2 scenarios:

```
bash ./scripts/cifar10_poison/cifar10_ULEO/resnet18.sh
bash ./scripts/cifar10_poison/cifar10_ULEO_GRAYAUG/resnet18.sh
```


#### Train a standard exploiter on ULEOs:

```
bash ./scripts/cifar10_train/standard_exploiter/cifar10_ULEO/resnet18.sh
```

#### Train a standard exploiter on ULEO-GrayAugs:

```
bash ./scripts/cifar10_train/standard_exploiter/cifar10_ULEO_GRAYAUG/resnet18.sh
```

#### Train a grayscale exploiter on ULEOs:

```
bash ./scripts/cifar10_train/gray_exploiter/cifar10_ULEO/resnet18.sh
```

#### Train a grayscale exploiter on ULEO-GrayAugs:

```
bash ./scripts/cifar10_train/gray_exploiter/cifar10_ULEO_GRAYAUG/resnet18.sh
```


ULE perturbations can be found in ```./experiments/cifar10_poison/```.
After running the scripts, training results can be found in the folder ```./experiments/cifar10_train/```.


### 2. Generate ULEs on MLPs and test transferability:

####  Generate ULEOs on MLPs:

```
bash scripts/cifar10_poison/cifar10_ULEO/mlp.sh
```

#### Test transferability to three CNNs:

```
bash ./scripts/cifar10_train/standard_exploiter/cifar10_ULEO/mlp2dense.sh
bash ./scripts/cifar10_train/standard_exploiter/cifar10_ULEO/mlp2resnet.sh
bash ./scripts/cifar10_train/standard_exploiter/cifar10_ULEO/mlp2vgg.sh
```


After running the scripts, the transferability results can be found in the folder ```./experiments/cifar10_cross/mlp2x/```.
